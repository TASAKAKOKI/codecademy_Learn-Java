    The charAt() method returns the character located at a String‘s specified index.
    For example:
        String str = "qwer";
        System.out.println(str.charAt(2));
    It would output e because that’s what’s at index 2. (Once again, indices start with 0.)
    Suppose we try return the character located at index 4, it would produce an error because index 4 is out of str‘s range.
