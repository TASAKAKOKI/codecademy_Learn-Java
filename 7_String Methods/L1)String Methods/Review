    Congratulations! ðŸ™Œ
    We have learned some of the string methods that come with the String class:
        length()
        concat()
        indexOf()
        charAt()
        equals() / equalsIgnoreCase()
        substring()
        toUpperCase() / toLowerCase()
    Instructions
        Feel free to play around with these string methods in the code editor before moving on.
