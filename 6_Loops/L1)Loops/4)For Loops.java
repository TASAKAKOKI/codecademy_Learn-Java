    Incrementing with loops is actually so common in programming that Java (like many other programming languages) includes syntax specifically to address this pattern: for loops. A for loop brings together the following steps in a single line, separated by semicolons:
        Initializing a counter variable.
        Defining the looping condition.
        Incrementing the counter.
    The opening line might look like this:
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            // code that will run
        }
    i = 0: i is initialized to 0.
    i < 5: the loop is given a condition that relies on the value of i.
    i++: i will increment at the end of each loop.
    So the code will run through the loop a total of five times.
    You’ll also hear the term “iteration” in reference to loops. When you iterate, it just means that you are repeating the same block of code.
