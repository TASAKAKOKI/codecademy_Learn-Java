    for loops aren’t just a nicer syntax; they also help us remember to increment our counter — something that is easy to forget when we increment with a while loop. Leaving out that line of code would cause an infinite loop — yikes!
    Fortunately, equipped with your new understanding of for loops, you can help prevent infinite loops in your own code.

    1.
    We’ve provided a while loop that loops from 1 to 100 outputting a string on each iteration. Refactor (rewrite) this code as a for loop.
    Remember, the syntax of a for loop looks like:
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        // code that will run
        }
