//Learn
    So far, we have learned primitive data types, which are the simplest types of data with no built-in behavior. Our programs will also use Strings, which are objects, instead of primitives. ***Objects have built-in behavior.
    ***Strings hold sequences of characters. Weâ€™ve already seen instances of a String, for example when you printed out "Hello World".
    Just like with a primitive, we declare the variable by specifying the type first:
        String greeting = "Hello World";
