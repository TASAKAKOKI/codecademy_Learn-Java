    One common use of polymorphism with Java classes is something we mentioned earlier — overriding parent class methods in a child class. Like the + operator, we can give a single method slightly different meanings for different classes. This is useful when we want our child class method to have the same name as a parent class method but behave a bit differently in some way.
    Let’s say we have a BankAccount class that allows us to print the current balance. We want to build a CheckingAccount class that inherits the functionality of a BankAccount but with a modified printBalance() method. We can do the following:
        class BankAccount {
            protected double balance;
            public void printBalance() {
                System.out.println("Your account balance is $" + balance);
            }
        }
        class CheckingAccount extends BankAccount {
            @Override
            public void printBalance() {
                System.out.println("Your checking account balance is $" + balance);
            }

        }
    Notice that in order to properly override printBalance(), in CheckingAccount the method has the following in common with the corresponding method in BankAccount:
        Method name
        Return type
        Number and type of parameters
    You may have also noticed the @Override keyword above printBalance() in CheckingAccount. This annotation informs the compiler that we want to override a method in the parent class. If the method doesn’t exist in the parent class, we’ll get a helpful error when we compile the program.

    Noodle has a cook() method that involves boiling the noodle and changing the texture to "cooked".
    The German noodle spätzle involves a slightly unconventional cooking procedure: grinding or scraping the dough into the pot of boiling water.
    In Spaetzle.java, override the inherited cook() method. Copy the original method body, but before "Boiling" gets printed, add a new line to print "Grinding or scraping dough.".
    Don’t forget to add @Override above the method to help with debugging.
