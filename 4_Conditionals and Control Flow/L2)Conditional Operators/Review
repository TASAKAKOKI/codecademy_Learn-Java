Review
    Conditional operators work on boolean values to simplify our code. Theyâ€™re often combined with conditional statements to consolidate the branching logic.
    Conditional-AND, &&, evaluates to true if the booleans on both sides are true.
        if (true && false) {
            System.out.println("You won't see me print!");
        } else if (true && true) {
            System.out.println("You will see me print!");
        }
    Conditional-OR, ||, evaluates to true if one or both of the booleans on either side is true.
        if (false || false) {
            System.out.println("You won't see me print!");
        } else if (false || true) {
            System.out.println("You will see me print!");
        }
    Logical-NOT, !, evaluates to the opposite boolean value to which it is applied.
        if (!false) {
            System.out.println("You will see me print!");
        }
        
Instructions
    The complete Reservation class is in the code editor.
    Play around inside main() and see if you can create instances that will run every possible conditional branch.

Reservation.java
    public class Reservation {
        int guestCount;
        int restaurantCapacity;
        boolean isRestaurantOpen;
        boolean isConfirmed;
        
        public Reservation(int count, int capacity, boolean open) {
            if (count < 1 || count > 8) {
            System.out.println("Invalid reservation!");
            }
            guestCount = count;
                restaurantCapacity = capacity;
                isRestaurantOpen = open;
        }  
        
        public void confirmReservation() {
            if (restaurantCapacity >= guestCount && isRestaurantOpen) {
            System.out.println("Reservation confirmed");
            isConfirmed = true;
            } else {
            System.out.println("Reservation denied");
                    isConfirmed = false;
            }
        }
        
        public void informUser() {
            if (!isConfirmed) {
            System.out.println("Unable to confirm reservation, please contact restaurant.");
            } else {
            System.out.println("Please enjoy your meal!");
            }
        }
        
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Create instances here
            
        }
    }
